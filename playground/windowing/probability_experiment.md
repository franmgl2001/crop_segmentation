## Windowing probability experiment
Exploring the Impact of Image Padding on Multicrop Classification Probability in Satellite Image Time Series (SITS), when padding the images. from front to back.


---

## Objective
To investigate how progressive padding of satellite image time series (SITS) affects the modelâ€™s classification probability for multicrop fields. Specifically, the hypothesis is that increasing padding around the images will lead to a decrease in the model's confidence in assigning a multicrop label, as the probability of a singlecrop label increased. 

---

## Methodology
1. Initialize the model with architecture and load weights.
2. Run the model on unpadded images to establish baseline probabilities.
3. Incrementally apply padding in 5-step intervals, rerunning the model at each stage.
4. Repeat step by steps, but instead of 
4. Plot and analyze the resulting softmax probabilities to observe changes in crop classification.

## Results
As shown the in the following figures the padding works well when doing it forward, but for some reason it is weird when windowing backwards.

## Next Steps
1. Train a single class model, and see how this type of input will behave.
2. Treat the multicrop as classes.
